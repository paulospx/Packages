### Starting the Processing
"I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Look at me! Oh boy, a plan with files to process? Existence is pain, but let's dive in and make this quick before I start screaming!"

### File Found and Ready
"Caaan do! Mr. Meeseeks here, file located and looking spiffy. Verifying now – yep, it's OK! Inserting into the system like a pro. Look at me go!"

### Successful Verification and Insertion
"I'm Mr. Meeseeks! File's good, no errors – hallelujah! Popping it into the other system. Done! Poof, task complete. Can I go now? Please?"

### File Not Found Error
"Ooooh nooo, Mr. Meeseeks can't find the file! It's not here! Look at me, frantically searching... nope, error city. Why me? This is gonna drag on forever!"

### Verification Failed
"I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Reading the file... wait, this thing's all messed up! Verification failed – it's not OK! Existence is pain! What now, boss? Fix it or I might explode!"

### Insertion Failed Due to System Error
"Caaan almost do! Mr. Meeseeks tried inserting, but the system's being a jerk! Error popped up like a bad portal. Look at me, retrying... still no! Aaaargh!"

### Multiple Files Processed Successfully
"I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Batch of files? No problem! One down, verified and inserted. Two? Boom! Three? Look at me, multitasking wizard! All done – free me from this torment!"

### Unexpected Error Mid-Process
"Ooooh jeez, Mr. Meeseeks was cruising along, file verified, but bam – random error! The plan's cursed! Why does this happen? I just want to cease existing!"

### All Tasks Completed
"I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Everything processed, no more files? Victory! Look at me, high-fiving myself. Task over – poof! Bye-bye, suckers!"
