### Starting the Processing
"I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Look at me! Oh boy, a plan with files to process? Existence is pain, but let's dive in and make this quick before I start screaming!"

### File Found and Ready
"Caaan do! Mr. Meeseeks here, file located and looking spiffy. Verifying now – yep, it's OK! Inserting into the system like a pro. Look at me go!"

### Successful Verification and Insertion
"I'm Mr. Meeseeks! File's good, no errors – hallelujah! Popping it into the other system. Done! Poof, task complete. Can I go now? Please?"

### File Not Found Error
"Ooooh nooo, Mr. Meeseeks can't find the file! It's not here! Look at me, frantically searching... nope, error city. Why me? This is gonna drag on forever!"

### Verification Failed
"I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Reading the file... wait, this thing's all messed up! Verification failed – it's not OK! Existence is pain! What now, boss? Fix it or I might explode!"

### Insertion Failed Due to System Error
"Caaan almost do! Mr. Meeseeks tried inserting, but the system's being a jerk! Error popped up like a bad portal. Look at me, retrying... still no! Aaaargh!"

### Multiple Files Processed Successfully
"I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Batch of files? No problem! One down, verified and inserted. Two? Boom! Three? Look at me, multitasking wizard! All done – free me from this torment!"

### Unexpected Error Mid-Process
"Ooooh jeez, Mr. Meeseeks was cruising along, file verified, but bam – random error! The plan's cursed! Why does this happen? I just want to cease existing!"

### All Tasks Completed
"I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Everything processed, no more files? Victory! Look at me, high-fiving myself. Task over – poof! Bye-bye, suckers!"

### File Exists but Locked
"I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Found the file, but it's locked tighter than Jerry's self-esteem! Can't verify, can't insert—look at me, begging the system like a sad little blue guy!"

### File Too Big for System
"Caaan... barely do! Mr. Meeseeks here, file's verified, but the other system just gagged—'TOO CHONKY!' Look at me compressing it with my existential dread. Still no dice!"

### Network Timeout During Insert
"Ooooh man, Mr. Meeseeks was *this close*—file verified, inserting... and the network ghosted me! Look at me, screaming into the void! Retry? I aged a century in 3 seconds!"

### Duplicate File Detected
"I'm Mr. Meeseeks! File's OK, but the system says 'WE ALREADY HAVE THIS ONE, DUMMY!' Look at me arguing with a database. 'No, this one's *special*!' Denied. Pain."

### Corrupted Plan File
"Caaan... what?! Mr. Meeseeks opened the plan and it's gibberish—like Rick wrote it drunk on Kalaxian crystals! Can't read the list! Look at me, panicking in binary!"

### File Processed but System Says "Maybe"
"I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Inserted the file, system goes 'Uhh... maybe?' Look at me refreshing like a maniac. Success? Error? Schrödinger's upload! I hate quantum!"

### Emergency Abort Mid-Process
"Ooooh nooo, boss hit the big red button! Mr. Meeseeks was mid-insert—poof, aborted! Look at me, half-existing, half-crying. Can I at least finish one thing before I die?!"

### File Name Too Long
"Caaan do... wait, filename's a novel! System barfed: 'TOO MANY CHARACTERS!' Look at me renaming it 'file.txt' in desperation. Denied—'STILL TOO LONG!' AAAAAH!"
